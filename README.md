# Charter development for a Publishing Working Group

This repo contains the [draft charter](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) for a Publishing Working Group, envisioned as part of the [combination of IDPF and W3C](https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en) announced on the 1st of February 2017.
The development of this charter was driven by the [Publishing Business Group](https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/) and it drew on the work of the [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/).

At this time the charter (whose [official location](https://www.w3.org/2017/04/publ-wg-charter/) has moved to the W3C space) is under the review of the W3C Advisory Committee. Unless some objections are raised during the approval process, the Working Group should begin its activities at the beginning of June 2017.

(See the [HTML view](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) of this page, or look at the [official location](https://www.w3.org/2017/04/publ-wg-charter/).)
