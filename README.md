# Charter development for a Publishing Working Group

This repo contains the [draft charter](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) for a Publishing Working Group, envisioned as part of the [combination of IDPF and W3C](https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en) announced on the 1st of February 2017.
The development of this charter was driven by the [Publishing Business Group](https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/) and it drew on the work of the [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/).

(See the [HTML view](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) of this page, or look at the [official location](https://www.w3.org/2017/04/publ-wg-charter/).)
