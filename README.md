This an [early draft](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) for the chartering process of a Publishing Working Group, envisioned as part of the [combination of IDPF and W3C](https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en) announced on the 1st of February 2017
The development of this charter is owned by the W3C Staff but is driven by the [Publishing Business Group](https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/). The early draft charter draws on the work of the [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/), and that group will continue to contribute to the technical aspects of the charter.
