                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    Publications, from magazine articles to product documentation, from electronic books to scholarly journal articles, are increasingly present on the Web.
                    While following the traditions of the publishing world in terms of typesetting, layout, ergonomy, and usage patterns, the Web brings a new level of pervasive accessibility, internationalization, addressability, and interconnectedness to these publications.
                    However, the combination of traditional publishing and the Web is not yet perfect: the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">“Web Publications Use Cases and Requirements”</a> document, published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a>, lists a number of use cases and requirements for publications on the Web.
                    It will be the task of the Working Group to identify those requirements that are not yet fully covered by the current environments based on the Open Web Platform, and would therefore need further work, while re-using existing technologies developed by other Working Groups as much as possible and practical.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is the goal of the Publishing Working Group to provide, in concert with other W3C Groups as outlined in <a href="#w3c-coordination">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>, the necessary technologies on the Open Web Platform to make the combination of traditional publishing and the Web complete in terms of the readers’ needs, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, or reliable cross referencing.
                    In short, <em>all publications—with all their specificities and traditions—should become first-class entities on the Web</em>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="scope" class="scope">
                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    For the purpose of this document, a Web Publication (WP) is a collection of one or more constituent resources, organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping that may be presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.
                    A Web Publication is not just a collection of links. The act of publishing involves obtaining resources and organizing them into a publication, which must be “manifested” by having files on a Web server.
                    Thus the publisher provides an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454">origin</a> for the WP, and a URL that can uniquely identify that <a href="https://archive.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr1.htm#3.2">(FRBR) manifestation</a>.
                    A Web Publication must provide a number of features whose detailed specification is in the scope of this Working Group.
                    While some of the detailed requirements have already been <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">documented elsewhere</a>, the most important and high-level characteristics that must be translated into specifications are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Web Publication may be portable, and it may be hosted at some other origin.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A Web Publication may be packaged by having all its constituent resources combined into a single file.
                        A Web Publication’s origin is essential information if it is to become portable.
                        The act of packaging must be reversible; one must be able to recover the original structure and organization.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It must be possible to make Web Publications accessible to a broad range of readers with different needs and capabilities.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A Web Publication must be available and functional while the user is offline.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A Web Publication, having an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources, will have metadata that describes the publication as a whole.
                    </li>

                    <li>A Web Publication must provide access to a range meta-information including (but not restricted to):
                        <ul style="margin-top:0.2em">
                            <li>table of contents, default or alternate reading order;</li>
                            <li>security and authentication data;</li>
                            <li>metadata such as author(s), title, and unique identification.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Recommendation-track deliverables will contain mechanisms to make Web Publications accessible to a broad range of readers with different needs and capabilities.
                    This includes general WCAG and WAI requirements of the W3C as well as requirements for international readers using different scripts and document formats.
                    Additional extended requirements will be identified as conformance requirements in the Working Group’s normative specifications, which will serve as a reference for content producers and for incorporation of publishing requirements in W3C standards like WCAG.
                    Profiles of Web Publications may be defined with more stringent accessibility requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/2017/SUBM-epub31-20170125/">EPUB</a> has become one of the fundamental technologies for the global publishing ecosystem (see the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pub-bg/docs/EPUB4_business_case.html">separate document</a>, published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/">W3C Publishing Business Group</a>, for more details and background).
                    It is the preferred format for a broad range of types of publications, not only for distribution but increasingly also for authoring and production workflows.
                    As part of the work on Web Publications, described in this charter, it is essential that a next generation of EPUB, currently referred to as EPUB&nbsp;4, retain the specificity, portability, predictability, accessibility, and internationalization required by the publishing ecosystem while benefitting from the improved features and functionalities offered by Packaged Web Publications.
                    EPUB&nbsp;4 should not be in conflict with Web Publications; it should be a type of Web Publication that provides the predictability and interoperability that this ecosystem has come to rely on.

                            <p>
                                This specification defines a Web Resource representing a collection of one or more constituent Web Resources, organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping that may be presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.
                                A Web Publication may represent a journal or magazine article, an in-house documentation, or a digital book.
                                It provides a standard to access information pertinent for the collection as a whole and that may be usable for the proper presentation of the publication.

                                This specification defines a way to combine the resources of a Web Publication into a distributable file using a packaging format.
                                Note that if the <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/">Packaging on the Web</a> work leads to a W3C Recommendation and fulfills all the requirements for Packaged Web Publications, publishing this deliverable <i>may</i> become unnecessary.

                                This specification defines a functional <em>profile</em> of the general idea of Packaged Web Publications that may deliver a higher degree of comprehensive accessibility capabilities and reliability.
                                This specification should generally be a functional superset of EPUB&nbsp;3.1.
                                Functional round-tripping to/from EPUB&nbsp;3.1 considered highly desirable.

                                These principles can inform the pagination of digital content as well, and serve as a reference for the CSS Working Group and other interested parties.

                                New CSS features may be needed to support web publications. Such features would be specified in the CSS Working Group, with the Publishing Working Group providing use cases, requirements, and examples.
                                The Publishing Working Group would also help the CSS WG with the development and testing of new and existing CSS functionality that is of interest to the publishing community.
                                The group will designate liaisons to work with the CSS WG on issues as needed. Liaisons will ideally be part of both groups.

                    To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from key implementors and users (e.g, publishers, authors) of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification.
                    The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group.
                    There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.

                    Working Drafts and Editor’s Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and the drafts may permit direct public contribution requests.
                    The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

                    Most Publishing Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications.
                    The calls will be conducted on a weekly basis.

                <p>
                    This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a " id="public-email" href="mailto:public-pub-wg@w3.org">public-pub-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pub-wg/">archive</a>) and on <a " id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/pub-wg/issues">GitHub issues</a> <span class="todo">[email and github addresses filled in if and when the charter is formally approved.]</span>.

                <h2> Decision Policy </h2>
                <p>
                    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
                    Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers. Consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, recording a decision along with any objections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
                    A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
                    If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have obtained consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
