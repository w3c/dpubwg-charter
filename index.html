                <p>This an early draft for the chartering process of a Publishing Working Group, envisioned as part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en">combination of IDPF and W3C</a> announced on the 1st of February 2017</a>.
				The development of this charter is owned by the W3C Staff but is driven by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/">Publishing Business Group</a>.
				The early draft charter draws on the work of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a>, and that group will continue to contribute to the technical aspects of the charter (<a href="#scope">2: “Scope”</a>, and <a href="#deliverables">3: “Deliverables”</a>).</p>

                <p>Issues and comments from the public at large are encouraged and highly welcome.
				Comments should be submitted by raising <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpubwg-charter/issues">issues on this (public) repository</a>.
				(In the case of a problems, comments can also be sent to the editor of this document, Ivan Herman, <a href="mailto:ivan@w3.org">ivan@w3.org</a>, who will submit the comment to the issue list in the commenter’s name.)</p>

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>
					Publications, from magazine articles to product documentation, from electronic books to scholarly journal articles, are increasingly present on the Web.
					While following the traditions of the publishing world in terms of typesetting, layout, ergonomy, and usage patterns, the Web brings a new level of pervasive accessibility, internationalization, addressability, and interconnectedness to these publications.
					However, the combination of traditional publishing and the Web is not yet perfect: the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">“Web Publications Use Cases and Requirements”</a> document, published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a>, lists a number of use cases and requirements that are not yet covered by the current environments based on the Open Web Platform.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is the goal of the Publishing Working Group to to provide, in concert with other W3C Groups as outlined in <a href="#w3c-coordination">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>, the necessary technologies to make the combination of traditional publishing and the Web complete in terms of the readers’ needs, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, or reliable cross referencing.
					In short, <em>all publications—with all their specificities and traditions—should become first-class entities on the Web</em>.
				</p>

            <section id="scope" class="scope">
                <h2>Scope</h2>
	            <p>
					For the purpose of this document, a Web Publication (WP) is a collection of one or more constituent resources, organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping that may be presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.
					A Web Publication is not just a collection of links. The act of publishing involves obtaining resources and organizing them into a publication, which must be “manifested” by having files on a Web server.
					Thus the publisher provides an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454">origin</a> for the WP, and a URL that can uniquely identify that <a href="https://archive.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr1.htm#3.2">(FRBR) manifestation</a>.
					A Web Publication must provide a number of features whose detailed specification is in the scope of this Working Group.
					While some of the detailed requirements have already been <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">documented elsewhere</a>, the most important and high-level characteristics that must be translated into specifications are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A Web Publication may be portable, and it may be hosted at some other origin.
						However, it must preserve information about its original origin and identity, so that references to a portable copy can be reconciled with the original publication, and so that the other origin can make informed choices about how much trust to grant to the publication.
					</li>

		            <li>
						A Web Publication may be packaged by having all its constituent resources combined into a single file.
						The package must include the unique identifier of the manifestation.
						A Web Publication’s origin is essential information if it is to become portable.
						The act of packaging must be reversible; one must be able to recover the original structure and organization.
					</li>

		            <li>
						It must be possible to make Web Publications accessible to a broad range of readers with different needs and capabilities.
					</li>

		            <li>
						A Web Publication must be available and functional while the user is offline.
						Users should, as much as possible, have a seamless experience of interacting with a Web Publication regardless of their network connection.
						When defining Web Publications, we make no distinction between online and offline reading.
						Regardless of their network connections, users should have a seamless experience interacting with a Web Publication.
						Any software agent consuming and rendering a Web Publication must ensure that it is available and functional while the user is offline.
					</li>

		            <li>
						A Web Publication, having an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources, will have metadata that describes the publication as a whole.
						We also introduce the abstract concept of a manifest, which serves to carry information about the constituent resources of the publication.
						The metadata and manifest will also incorporate information about the sequence and presentation of the content.
					</li>

					<li>A Web Publication must provide access to a range meta-information including (but not restricted to):
						<ul style="margin-top:0.2em">
							<li>table of contents, default or alternate reading order;</li>
							<li>security and authentication data;</li>
							<li>metadata such as author(s), title, and unique identification.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Recommendation-track deliverables will contain mechanisms to make Web Publications accessible to a broad range of readers with different needs and capabilities.
					This includes requirements of W3C WCAG 2.0 or ATAG 2.0 (or later versions) as well as requirements for international readers using different scripts and document formats.
					Additional extended requirements will be identified as conformance requirements in the Working Group’s normative specifications.
					Profiles of Web Publications may be defined with more stringent accessibility requirements.
				</p>

				<p>
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/2017/SUBM-epub31-20170125/">EPUB</a> has become one of the fundamental technologies for the global publishing ecosystem (see the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pub-bg/docs/EPUB4_business_case.html">separate document</a>, published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/">W3C Publishing Business Group</a>, for more details and background). It is the preferred format for a broad range of types of publications, not only for distribution but increasingly also for authoring and production workflows.  As part of the work on Web Publications, described in this charter, it is also critical that a next generation of EPUB, currently referred to as EPUB&nbsp;4, retain the specificity, portability, predictability, accessibility, and internationalization required by the publishing ecosystem while benefitting from the improved features and functionalities offered by Packaged Web Publications. EPUB&nbsp;4 must not be in conflict with Web Publications; it must be a type of Web Publication that provides the predictability and interoperability that this ecosystem has come to rely on.

                    <p>
                        Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each specification should contain a section describing: known impacts on accessibility for users with disabilities; ways the specification features address those impacts; and recommendations for minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.

                <p>
                    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
					Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers. Consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, recording a decision along with any objections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
					A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
					If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have obtained consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
